## Key Concepts

Private smart contracts on Aztec differ from traditional Ethereum contracts in several ways:

- **Private State** - Contract state can be kept private using notes
- **Private Functions** - Function execution can be private, with only proofs posted on-chain
- **Public Functions** - Standard public functions are also supported
- **Hybrid State** - Contracts can use both private and public state together
