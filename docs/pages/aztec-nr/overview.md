# Aztec.nr Overview

## Mike's notes

1. Intro 
    1. Noir vs Aztecnr ←- move it somewhere
    2. Justify [Aztec.nr](http://Aztec.nr) - why do we need it?
    3. Design principles
        - (Example):
            - Make it hard to shoot yourself in the foot.
            - Make it clear when something is unsafe.
            - Rails that intentionally trigger a developer's "WTF?" response, to ensure they understand what they're doing.
