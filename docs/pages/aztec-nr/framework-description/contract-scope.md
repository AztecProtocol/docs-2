# Contract Scope

## Mike's Notes

- Discuss:
    - how to declare a contract.
    - Differences vs conventional Noir program.
    - Essential imports
    - Describe limitations (no inheritance, currently, so big monolithic contract files)
        - This will change significantly next year, after Noir 1.0 is audited and launched.

## Ciara's notes 

Literally like they syntax of how to create a contract in Noir. E.g. in solidity we would explain the `contract` keyword, explain the scope that its sorta like a class and that you have to name it :)
