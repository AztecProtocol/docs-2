# Optimizations, Gas and Profiling

Learn how to optimize your Aztec smart contracts and understand gas costs.

## Overview

Performance and cost optimization are critical for building efficient Aztec applications. This section covers strategies for reducing gas costs and improving contract performance.

## Topics

### Understanding Costs
- **[Gas](./gas)** - How gas works in Aztec and fee mechanisms

### Optimization Techniques
- **[Profiling](./profiling)** - Tools and techniques for profiling contract performance
- **[Optimizing Functions](./optimizing-functions)** - Best practices for writing efficient functions
- **[Choosing Numeric Types](./numeric-types)** - Selecting the right numeric types for gas efficiency

## Key Considerations

When optimizing Aztec contracts, consider:

- **Proof Generation Costs** - Private functions require proof generation
- **Public vs Private** - Different cost models for public and private execution
- **Storage Access** - Reading and writing state has different costs
- **Circuit Size** - Larger circuits are more expensive to prove
