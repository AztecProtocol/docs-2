# Wallet CLI Overview

For development, it may be useful to deploy, transact, or create notes in a non-programmatic way. The wallet CLI (`aztec-wallet`) can be used for the following:

- Deploying contracts
- Sending transactions
- Bridging L1 "Fee Juice" into Aztec
- Pushing arbitrary notes to your PXE
- Creating authwits
- Aliasing info and secrets for further usage
- Proving your transactions and profile gate counts
